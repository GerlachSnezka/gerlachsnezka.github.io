## Introduction
In this challenge, we are presented with a scenario where signing a magical contract accidentally involves the flag instead of one's name. It's a common mistake, right? Contracts... they can be tricky.

## Solution
We were provided with a PDF file to examine. Despite a thorough search, no hidden flags were found within the text of the PDF. However, not all hope was lost. By using the handy tool [extractpdf.com](https://www.extractpdf.com/), we managed to extract images embedded within the document.

One of these extracted images contained a flag, which only participants with the most advanced skills could solve.
