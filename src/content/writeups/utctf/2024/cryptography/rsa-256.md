## Introduction

In this task, we are given a file `vals.txt` which contains the values of `N`, `e`, and `c`.

> **Explanatory notes**  
> (N, e) is the public key  
> c is the ciphertext  

## Solving

This problem can be easily solved by integer factorization, explained more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Security_and_practical_considerations). I used simple tool called [X-RSA](https://github.com/X-Vector/X-RSA).

![x-rsa one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GerlachSnezka/utctf/main/assets/2024-crypto-rsa256.png)  
![x-rsa second](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GerlachSnezka/utctf/main/assets/2024-crypto-rsa256-2.png)

We can simply use the first attack for `c, n, e` and get the flag.
This tools uses [http://factordb.com/](http://factordb.com/) under the hood but we can also compute it on our own machine using [cado-nfs](https://cado-nfs.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) :D
